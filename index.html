        		Jesse Custer is the main protagonist from writer Garth Ennis' series “Preacher.” While ministering to a congregation in rural Texas Custer becomes possessed by a spirit that is the product of an angel and a daemon. After this coupling, Jesse discovers that he has the ability to make any person follow his will. With this power he sets on a quest to find God and hold Him accountable for his childhood.

                While the original premise of the series may seem a bit obscure, Ennis humanizes Custer’s adventures as a spiritual and explores subjects such as forgiveness, trust and reconciliation.
